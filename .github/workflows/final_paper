## Introduction
  What Russian officials intended to be a swift victory has become an all-out war beginning February 24th. It is not surprising that since then, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has done his best to isolate his country and censor the language used to talk about the invasion into Ukraine. Externally, Putin has blocked access to many foreign news outlets and social media platforms where the Russian government was not easily able to spread propaganda including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok. However, Putin and his government have still allowed for YouTube and the encrypted messaging app know as Telegram to stay active, since they are two platforms that are used to heavily spread state propaganda but even their timeline in Russia is not guaranteed and it is up to Putin's discretion whether they get shut down in the future. To make matters even more sever, the Russian government has made it a crime to spread false information about the invasion with a penalty of up to 15 years in prison and they have criminalizes any public opposition or independent news reporting on the invasion of Ukraine. This news meant that as of March 5th, when the law was passed, something as small as referring to the fighting going on in Ukraine as anything other than a “special military operation” in any social media post or news broad cast would be considered a crime. Seeing as that is an incredibly heavy penalty for the practice of free speech a decision was made to look at this for the final project and analyze the first 281 days of the war to figure out what the actual cost of the war is for the Russian Armed forces including the losses of equipment and personnel. This information was then coupled with a through web-scraping and the use of google trends to see if there is a correlation between the total losses the Russian Armed forces took in any given day to the use of potentially illegal words such as “war” and “battle” in the Russian media on that same day to see if the loss of life and machines were a driving factor for the defiance of the Russian media.

This section outlines the research idea. We can also cite related work here [@Wickham2014; @Baumer2017].

Note that compiled term paper (the PDF) is supposed to be more text-centered than the RMarkdown documents we used in class, i.e. the text sections are more detailed and big or redundant code chunks can be hidden.

## Data
  Before any of the analysis could be done it was imperative that the data being used for the Russian military was correct and updated daily. After carefully scouring through many different sites we were able to find data on Kaggle that was updated daily and included a battle damage assessment of Russian forces including personnel and multiple types of equipment. That data was then restructured so that instead of physical dates the data went from day one to day 281 so that it could be best analyzed and then bound together to create one dataset in R. We then moved on to web scraping to gather the information on estimates of the Russian army as a whole, what battles were occurring and how frequently they were fighting, and specific sentiments to their losses.

```{r}
Russia <-cbind(Russia.Equipment, Russia.Personnel)

## Results

This section presents the main results.

### Data exploration

The results section may have a data exploration part, but in general the structure here depends on the specific project.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
R1 <- plot(Russia$day, Russia$personnel)
R1
R2 <- plot(Russia$day, Russia$tank)
R2

qplot(Russia$day, Russia$personnel)+ xlab("Days") + ylab("Personnel")

qplot(Russia$day, Russia$PBD)+ xlab("Days") + ylab("Deaths") 
R4 <-lm(day ~ personnel, data = Russia)
abline(R4)

barplot(Russia$day, Russia$TPB)+ xlab("Days") + ylab("Tank Loss")
```

```{r}
# What happens here depends on the specific project
```

### Analysis

This section presents the main results, such as (for example) stats and graphs that show relationships, model results and/or clustering, PCA, etc.
